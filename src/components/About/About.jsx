        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>I once climbed one of the hardest sections of the Superior Hiking Trail. It was seven miles of strenuous, rugged, and steep terrain. 
          While I was hiking, I considered turning around and ending the hike about 100 times (probably more, if I'm being honest!). 
          But despite just giving birth, high humidity, and not having enough caffeine in my system, I kept going. 
          Because I'm that person - once I set my mind to something, it happens.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now, take that determination and put it into my day-to-day work - I may not be climbing mountains every day but I certainly do move them.
        With the aid of my multi-colored post-it notes (you will be hard-pressed to find me without them), the most challenging and complex of projects
        will be succinctly broken down into manageable and attainable action points. I excel in a role where I am working with teams across multiple
        different departments; bridging the gap between the technical and non-technical world is a passion of mine.
        </p>

        <p>If you're interested in grabbing a coffee and talking code (or to get my secret recipe for trail mix), please send an email or message my way.</p>
